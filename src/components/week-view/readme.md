The setup for a WeekView only involves creating a `div` with the class `week-view` and then initializing the plugin. The startDate and endDate control the days shown.
So if you wanted a day only view you would pass exactly one day. The exact time is important. Days start on 0, 0, 0, 0 and end on 59, 59, 59 for example:

```javascript
startDate: new Date(2019, 09, 21, 0, 0, 0, 0),
endDate: new Date(2019, 09, 21, 23, 59, 59, 59),
```

For other configurations see below.

```html
<div class="full-height full-width">
  <div class="week-view" data-init="false">
  </div>
</div>

```

## Event Data

The weekview runs off event data like the calendar, which should be an array of objects. An example of an event is..

```JSON
{
"id": "9",
"subject": "Autumn Foliage Trip",
"comments": "Annual Autumn Foliage Trip",
"status": "Pending",
"icon": "icon-clock",
"starts": "2018-10-22T00:00:00.000",
"ends": "2018-10-24T23:59:59.999",
"type": "dto",
"isAllDay": "false"
}
```

The following data fields are used.

- id - A unique event id
- subject - The event subject, which will be displayed on the event in the calendar
- shortSubject - If the subject is long, the shortSubject will be used to display on the calendar, the longer subject will show in the event details.
- comments - Any additional comments that will be shown in the event details
- status - A text status that will be shown in the event details (with optional icon on the calendar)
- icon - A the name of the icon from the supported icons
- location - A location for the event that will be shown in the event details
- starts - The date/time when the event starts
- ends - The date/time when the event ends
- type - The eventType key, this must have a match in the eventTypes array
- isAllDay - Determines if the event is all day or not

The event types is a seperate data structure that looks like this:

```JSON
{
  "id": "dto",
  "label": "Discretionary Time Off",
  "translationKey": "DiscretionaryTimeOff",
  "color": "azure",
  "checked": true,
  "disabled": false
},
```

The following data fields are used.

- id - A unique eventType id
- label - The label that will show up in the legend
- translationKey - The key that will be looked up in the locale data
- color - The color from the color palette (without the color number)
- checked - If true the event checkbox will appear checked
- disabled - If true the event checkbox will appear disabled from use

## Accessibility

The Weekview is a very complex control we do the following:

- Add an `aria` to the calendar elements
- Add `aria-selected=true` to selected day
- Most of the legend colors should be WCAG compliant
- We use icons and color and text for the status's of the calendar events
- Support keyboard

## Keyboard Shortcuts

TBD

## Upgrading from 3.X

- This is a new component for 4.x
