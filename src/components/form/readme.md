## Layout Classes

For text/typography specific classes see the classes section on the [typography page]( ./typography)

The following classes can be used for form labels:

- `label` - Used for styling spans like labels or form labels.
- `data-description` - Used for stying data in a label when used next to an input.
- `data` - Used for stying data in a label without an input, if you would like to align the inputs with other fields in the form, you can add the class `field-height` See Example](./demo/components/form/test-field-size-data-labels?font=source-sans).

The following classes can be used for form and label alignment.

- `form-responsive` - Makes all the fields inside go to width 100% so that the fields will align in a responsive grid. You have the option to use fixed field sizes (default) or responsive forms. This class forces a responsive form, so all fields will size to 100%. [See Example](./demo/components/form/example-inputs?font=source-sans)
- `form-responsive flex-align-bottom` - A responsive form but in some cases may like the labels to wrap and still have the fields align below the labels add the class, this class will do the job.  [See Example](./demo/components/form/example-align-field-bottoms?font=source-sans)
- `field-flex` - Makes all the labels and fields inside go into a side by side layout. Yet still work responsively. This can be used for labels input description situations or to force some labels to sit together , similar to compound fields [See Example](./demo/components/form/example-labels?font=source-sans)
- `label-left` - Used to put a label and data label to the left of each other rather than on top. This may be used on some forms but not with editable inputs. [See Example](./demo/form/example-labels?font=source-sans)
- `compound-field` - Used to put several fields next to each other in a row. This may be used for related fields like phone + extension [See Example](./demo/form/example-forms?font=source-sans)
- `compound-field` - Used to put several fields next to each other in a row. This may be used for related fields like phone + extension [See Example](./demo/form/example-forms?font=source-sans)
- `form-layout-compact` - Used to set the form fields in a more compact mode so more fields can fit in the page. [See Example](./demo/form/example-compact-mode?font=source-sans)

## Accessibility

### Field labels

In/After IDS version 4.18.1, changes were made to form labels with a required asterisk `(*)` that provide better identification in screen readers. This involves a breaking change to existing required label elements, since adding additional markup is necessary. The Form component will automatically convert labels to the new, accessibility-friendly method of display if the developer simply adds an `.accessible` CSS class to the `<label>` or `.label-text` element. For more information, see Github issues [#421](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/421) and [#2118](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/2118).
